I recommend downloading/printing the required readings ahead of time, just in case.)

  * The Birth of Git
2. Chapter 3: Getting Started
  * Intro
  * The Git Command Line
  * Quick Introduction to Using Git (read all sections)
  * Configuration files (Intro only, may skip part on aliases)
3. Chapter 4: Basic Git Concepts
  * Basic concepts (read all)
  * Object store pictures
  * Git concepts at work (read all)
4. Chapter 21: Git and Github
  * Repo for Public Code
  * Creating a GitHub Repository
  * Forks
  * Creating Pull Requests
  * Managing Pull Requests
  * Coding Models

**Open Data Structures in C++**. Morin, edition 0.1G-beta

http://opendatastructures.org/ (Free access. I recommend downloading the PDF version.)

Read the following:

1. Chapter 1 (pp. 1-21)

Homework
========

1. Create an account with github.com. You may select the free account. If you want to get some free private repos, you may apply at https://github.com/edu
2. Go to https://github.com/MiamiOH-CSE274/01_Git_and_Intro and fork the repo, which will create a copy of it in your github account.
3. Install git on your computer, if you do not already have it. I recommend installing http://windows.github.com/ if you use windows, or http://mac.github.com/ if you use Mac. **HOWEVER, I highly recommend using the command-line tools for everything, and ignoring the GUI. I will not be providing help with configuring/using the GUI.**
4. Clone your repo from github to your computer. When you are at the web page for your repo, `https://github.com/[your github id]/01_Git_and_Intro`, you will see info about how to clone it. The easiest way is to go to the command line terminal, and type `git clone git@github.com:[your github id]/01_Git_and_Intro.git`
6. Complete the exercises below by modifying this file.
7. After you complete each answer, be sure to create a new commit with the changes (using `git add README.md` and `git commit -m` as appropriate). Also, be sure to upload to github frequently by using `git push`
8. If I don't see at least 4-5 commits on this homework, I'm going to be unhappy.
9. Once complete, send me a pull request. This is your official "turn in" of the homework, which I will grade.
10. Double check that you did the right thing by going to https://github.com/MiamiOH-CSE274/01_Git_and_Intro/pulls and making sure that your pull request is there, and looks like you expect. Optimism is the root of all evil.

Exercises
=========

#### 1. Based on the reading in the Git book, is it okay to keep your local copy of your repo on a USB drive and just carry it around? Explain why or why not. What about keeping it on the M: drive?

Yes to both. Because Git is all about freedom. A repository also contains all history and revisions of the files as well as the files themselves and a copy of the repository itself, so there is no information lost by keeping just the repository in an isolated environment like the flash drive.
** not sure about this answer? no mention in text

#### 2. Imagine that you come into the lab on the weekend to work on homework with friends, but you forgot to bring your USB drive with your repo on it. What should you do?

Clone your forked repo from Github onto the lab machine and proceed as normal.
** also not sure about this one.

#### 3. Morin, Exercise 1.1 (p. 25). NOTE: You should not actually implement the solution with code. Instead, explain your solution using English. Pay special attention to explaining which data structure you ought to use, and why.

[Your answer here]

#### 4. Your choice: Morin, Exercise 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4 (pick one)

Note: You should not need to write any real computer code for any of these. Instead, explain how you would approach the problem using a combination of English and pseudocode. The goal is to write something that is understandable by any programmer, even if the two of you have never used the same computer language. (In other words, assume the other person does not know the syntax of Java or C/C++, but knows the basic programming constructs such as for loops, if statements, variables, and so on.)

#### 5. Define/explain each of the following terms, as they relate to git.

1. blob - "binary large object", used to represent each version of a file. Holds the file's data but no metadata about it or even its name.
2. tree - represents one level of directory information. Records all blob IDs, paths, and some file metadata in that directory in order to build a complete hierarchy of files and subdirectories.
3. commit - contains metadata for each change to the repository that has been staged, including author, committer, commit date and log message. Each commit points to a tree that captures the current state of the repository.
4. repo - short for repository, it's a database containing all the info necessary to retain and manage the revisions and history of a project.
5. hash - SHA1 applied to the contents of the object, yielding a hash value. Also called the object ID, will change with any tiny change to the object which causes versions to be indexed separately.
