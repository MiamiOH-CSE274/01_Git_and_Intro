Data Structures Notes 9/4
=========================

Stack -> push, pop = LIFO, useful for reversing the order of things  
Queue -> enqueue,dequeue (same as push/pop BUT) = FIFO  
Dequeue -> all same function as Stack & Queue  
Priority Queue  
List  
SSet  
USet -> faster than SSet  

Abstract Data Type
------------------
-What operations are supported?
-What rules does the data follow?

**Data Structures** -> How do you build a program that uses these types efficiently

*How do you manage collections of data?*

Question 7, sorting with duplicates -- Use a set to store both the line and the count of how many times you've seen it, then at the end print it out that many times.

Don't forget to go back and edit homework.
