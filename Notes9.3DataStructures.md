Data Structures Notes 9/4
=========================

Stack -> push, pop = LIFO, useful for reversing the order of things
Queue -> enqueue,dequeue (same as push/pop BUT) = FIFO
Dequeue -> all same function as Stack & Queue
Priority Queue
List
SSet
USet -> faster than SSet

Abstract Data Type
------------------
-What operations are supported?
-What rules does the data follow?

**Data Structures** -> How do you build a program that uses these types efficiently

*How do you manage collections of data?*
